## v2.2.0 (2020-10-29)

Default download database version has been pinned to "release 3.13.1" after major changes in the upstream sources ([matomo-org/device-detector](https://github.com/matomo-org/device-detector) moving towards a new major release).

There will be a new major version of `ua_inspector` with a rebuilt database support for `matomo-org/device-detector@v4.x` and/or a separate database built upon these sources to simplify future upgrades.

- Enhancements
    - Upstream improvements to detect engine versions of "Gecko" type browsers have been integrated

    - If detectable the "browser family" of a client is now available as `:browser_family` in the result struct
    - If detectable the "operating system family" of a client is now available as `:os_family` in the result struct

- Bug fixes
    - The mix download task should no longer start unnecessary applications ([#19](https://github.com/elixir-inspector/ua_inspector/issues/19))

- Backwards incompatible changes
    - Minimum required Elixir version is now `~> 1.7`
    - Several deprecated functions have been removed completely:
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.prepare_database_path/0`
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.read_remote/0`
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.README.path_local/0`
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.README.path_priv/0`
    - Startup is now done with a blocking database load by default

## v1.2.0 (2019-08-10)

- Enhancements
    - Warnings when starting without a database available can be silenced

- Bug fixes
    - The mix download task now works properly with initializer modules ([#18](https://github.com/elixir-inspector/ua_inspector/issues/18))

## v1.1.0 (2019-07-13)

- Enhancements
    - Configuring `startup_sync: true` allows you to ensure a synchronous database load is attempted before allowing to parse user agents
    - Database entries are now stored in a single named table instead of using an intermediate reference table
    - Output of mix task `ua_inspector.download` can be prevented by passing `--quiet` upon invocation. This does NOT imply `--force` and will still ask for confirmation
    - Passing `async: false` to `UAInspector.reload/1` allows you to block your calling process until the reload has finished
    - The library used to download the database files can be changed by configuring a module implementing the `UAInspector.Downloader.Adapter` behaviour
    - The library used to read YAML files can be changed by using the `:yaml_file_reader` configuration

- Bug fixes
    - Matching the documentation the informational README file created by the downloader will now only be created when using the mix task

- Deprecations
    - Several functions are now declared internal and will result in a `Logger.info/1` message when called until they will be eventually removed:
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.prepare_database_path/0`
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.read_remote/0`
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.README.path_local/0`
        - `UAInspector.Downloader.README.path_priv/0`

    - The default database path has been set to `Application.app_dir(:ua_inspector, "priv")`

- Backwards incompatible changes
    - Internal parser process pooling has been removed. If you require pooling you need to manually wrap `UAInspector.parse/1` (and related functions)

    - Support for `{:system, var}` configuration has been removed
    - The deprecated mix tasks `ua_inspector.download.databases` and `ua_inspector.download.short_code_maps` have been removed

## v0.20.0 (2019-03-10)

- Enhancements
    - Initializer modules can be defined with additional arguments by using `{mod, fun, args}`
    - When using the default database you can now set a `:remote_release` to be used for downloading. The default is `"master"` but any valid commit from the upstream source is allowed

    - Accessing the system environment by configuring `{:system, var}` or `{:system, var, default}` will now result in a `Logger.info/1` message and will stop working in a future release
    - The download tasks `ua_inspector.download.databases` and `ua_inspector.download.short_code_maps` are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release

## v0.19.2 (2019-02-12)

- Bug fixes
    - Short code maps are now stored in the correct file encoding (`UTF-8`) to allow parsing short code maps with characters like umlauts ([#15](https://github.com/elixir-inspector/ua_inspector/issues/15))

## v0.19.1 (2019-01-05)

- Enhancements
    - The (soft) deprecated download tasks `ua_inspector.download.databases` and `ua_inspector.download.short_code_maps` are no longer displayed in the output of `mix help`

## v0.19.0 (2019-01-03)

- Enhancements
    - All database files (parser databases and short code maps) can be downloaded using a single mix task `ua_inspector.download`
    - Downloading the databases ensures hackney is started to allow calling `mix run --no-start -e "UAInspector.Downloader.download()"`
    - Finding the data table is now done via a named lookup table instead of calling the database state server
    - If you need to check if all databases are loaded (i.e. "no longer empty") you can use `UAInspector.ready?/0`
    - OS Families are no longer hardcoded inside `Util.OS` but read from the original source and stored in a short code map
    - OS Families used for desktop detection are no longer hardcoded inside `Util.OS` but read from the original source and stored in a short code map
    - Reloading will now issue a warning if no database path is configured while resuming operation with an empty database

- Soft deprecations (no warnings)
    - The individual download tasks for databases and short code maps have been removed from the documentation. They are still completely functional but will eventually be removed after a proper deprecation phase

## v0.18.0 (2018-08-15)

- Enhancements
    - Configuration can be done on supervisor (re-) start or when running the mix download tasks by setting a `{mod, fun}` tuple for the config key `:init`. This method will be called without arguments.
    - Old data tables are deleted with a configurable delay after reloading to avoid race conditions (and the resulting empty lookup responses)

- Bug fixes
    - ETS tables of short code maps are now properly cleaned after reload

- Soft deprecations (no warnings)
    - Support for `{:system, "ENV_VARIABLE"}` configuration has been removed from the documentation. It will eventually be removed completely after a proper deprecation phase

- Enhancements
    - References to `piwik` (like database URLs) have been updated to reflect the rename to `matomo`

## v0.16.1 (2018-01-17)

- Bug fixes
    - Broken module naming for the mix download tasks has been fixed ([#12](https://github.com/elixir-inspector/ua_inspector/issues/12))

## v0.16.0 (2018-01-05)

- Backwards incompatible changes
    - Minimum required Elixir version is now `~> 1.3`

## v0.15.1 (2018-01-17)

## v0.14.0 (2017-05-31)

- Enhancements
    - Empty user agents (`""` or `nil`) now return a result without performing an actual lookup. By definition an empty user agent is never detected as a bot
    - System environment configuration can set an optional default value to be used if the environment variable is unset

- Bug fixes

- Backwards incompatible changes
    - Completely unknown devices now yield `:unknown` instead of a struct with all values set to `:unknown`
    - Downloads are now done using `:hackney` instead of `mix`. This may force you to manually reconfigure the client
    - Minimum required Elixir version is now `~> 1.2`
    - Minimum required Erlang version is now `~> 18.0`
